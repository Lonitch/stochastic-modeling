    "## A Choice of Compartment Size $h$\n",
    "---\n",
    "**What is the appropriate choice of the compartment size $h$?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, for reactionâ€“diffusion systems involving only zeroth- and first-order chemical reactions we can increase the accuracy of the SSA by decreasing h.\n",
    "\n",
    "The situation is much more delicate when the system involves second- or higher-order reactions. In that case, **although diffusion is modelled more accurately as h is decreased, the reactions are modelled less accurately as h is decreased, so that we lose accuracy if we choose h too small**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for the bound on h from below is that **the second-order reaction does not happen as frequently as it should for small values of h**. One way to fix this problem is to **increase the probability of reaction for two molecules in the same compartment**. Please see [Erban and Chapman (2009)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1478-3975/6/4/046001/meta) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is suggested to choose $h \\text { small (to satisfy } L \\gg h)$ but not too small (to satisfy $\\left.h \\gg k /\\left(D_{A}+D_{B}\\right)\\right) .$ The optimal choice of $h$ is a subject of current research, see [Isaacson and Zhang (2018).](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.04220.pdf) and [Hellander and Petzold (2016)](https://cse.cs.ucsb.edu/sites/cse.cs.ucsb.edu/files/publications/1.5002773.pdf)."
