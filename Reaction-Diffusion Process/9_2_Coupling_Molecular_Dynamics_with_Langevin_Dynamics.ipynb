    "Our illustrative MD example is an analytically tractable microscopic MD model of Brownian motion which was formulated in Notebook(8.4) in terms of a (heavy) diffusing particle (described as a ball $B$ with radius $R$ and mass $m_{p}$ ) colliding with a large number of (light) point solvent particles with masses $m_{s} \\ll m_{p} .$ Denoting the coordinates of the centre of the heavy particle by $\\mathbf{X}=\\left[X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}\\right]$ and its velocity by $\\mathbf{V}=\\left[V_{1}, V_{2}, V_{3}\\right],$ we showed that they converge to the solution of the Langevin equation in the limit $m_{p} / m_{s} \\rightarrow \\infty,$ provided that the density and velocity distributions of solvent particles are scaled accordingly."
