    "Now we consider the *second-order* chemical reactions:\n",

    "we would expect the two molecules to collide twice as often in a box that is half the size. Thus for one molecule of A and one molecule of B the probability of a reaction occurring in the time interval $[t,t+dt)$ is $(k/v)dt$. Consequently, the probability that a second-order reaction takes place in the time interval $[t, t+d t)$ between any of these pairs is equal to $A(t) B(t)(k / v) \\mathrm{d} t$, where $A(t) B(t)(k / v)=\\alpha(t)$ is a **propensity function**. For the reaction of $A+A \\stackrel{k}{\\longrightarrow} C$, we have $\\alpha(t)=A(t)(A(t)-1) k / v$, where $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}{A(t)} \\\\ {2}\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{A(t)(A(t)-1)}{2}$, and the factor of 2 is absorbed into the rate constant.\n",
